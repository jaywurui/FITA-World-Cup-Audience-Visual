## Exploratory Analysis
The objective of the interactive visualization application is to provide users (sponsors) with useful information about different World Cup TV audience in different FIFA member countries and help them determine which nation’s TV rights is more valuable and lucrative to invest their money in.  The total number of World Cup TV audience in different countries and the audience’s purchasing-power GDP are the two important variables that can assist sponsors to make a decision.  A scatter plot with the number of audience as x-axis and audience’s GDP as y-axis is a highly effective visualization design to help sponsors easily make comparisons, find patterns, and understand the correlations between the two important variables.  In general, the country with most audience and high disposable income should be more valuable and lucrative to sponsors.  In addition, this interactive visualization application includes dropdown feature, mouse-hover tooltip feature, and mouse-hover highlight feature (both grouped data points highlight and individual data point highlight).  These interactive features allow sponsors to easily filter the dataset to focus on each single confederation data, quickly access detailed information, and easily make comparisons between different confederations and different countries.
